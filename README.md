# SpaceClouds42's notes form learning Rust


## Basic project management

### Creating a project

```bash
cargo new project_name
cd project_name
nano main.rs
```

### Compiling

```bash
cargo build
```

Executable is generated in the `target/debug/project_name` directory. When building for a release, use `cargo build --release` so that it compiles
with optimizations. Release executables are generated in the `target/release/project_name` directory. It will take longer to compile, but the 
executable will run faster than the unoptimized build.

To test that the code can compile without generating an executable, run `cargo check`.


### Running

To run a Rust program, simply run the executable generated by compiling. To compile and run at once, run `cargo run`.
